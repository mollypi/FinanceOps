## Introduction

This is a collection of research papers on long-term investing, portfolio
optimization, etc. They are written as Python Notebooks so they can easily be
modified and run again.


## Papers

The following Python Notebooks produce the plots and statistics for some of my
"normal" research papers which can be downloaded from
[SSRN](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1993051)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/Finance-Papers).

## Videos

There is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9Hr9sNUjfsmlHaWuVxIA0pKL1yjryR0Z) for each research paper.


## Downloading

The Python Notebooks use source-code located in different files to allow for easy re-use
across multiple Notebooks. It is therefore recommended that you download the whole
repository from GitHub, instead of just downloading the individual Python Notebooks.


### Git

The easiest way to download and install this is by using git from the command-line:

    git clone https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/FinanceOps.git

This creates the directory `FinanceOps` and downloads all the files to it.

This also makes it easy to update the files, simply by executing this command inside that directory:

    git pull


### Zip-File

You can also [download](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/FinanceOps/archive/master.zip)
the contents of the GitHub repository as a Zip-file and extract it manually.


## Installation

If you want to run these tutorials on your own computer, then it is best
to use a virtual environment when installing the required packages,
so you can easily delete the environment again.

The following command creates a virtual environment named `financeops`:

    virtualenv financeops

Or you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) instead of a virtualenv:

    conda create --name financeops python=3

Then you switch to the virtual environment and install the required packages:

    source activate financeops
    pip install -r requirements.txt

When you are done working on the project you can deactivate the virtualenv:

    source deactivate


## How To Run

Once you have installed the required Python packages in a virtual environment,
you run the following commands from the `FinanceOps` directory to view, edit
and run the Notebooks:

    source activate financeops
    jupyter notebook

If you want to edit the other source-code then you may use the free version of
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


### Run in Google Colab

If you do not want to install anything on your own computer, then the Notebooks
can be viewed, edited and run entirely on the internet by using
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

You click the "Google Colab"-link next to the research papers listed above.
You can view the Notebook on Colab but in order to run it you need to login using
your Google account.

Then you need to execute the following commands at the top of the Notebook,
which clones FinanceOps to your work-directory on Colab, and installs all the
required Python packages:

    # Clone the repository from GitHub to Google Colab's temporary drive.
    import os
    work_dir = "/content/FinanceOps/"
    if not os.path.exists(work_dir):
        !git clone https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/FinanceOps.git
    os.chdir(work_dir)

    # Install the required Python packages.
    !pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that you will need to run this every time you login to Google Colab.


### Run in Docker

Because many of these Notebooks and some of the Python packages also read/write
data on the local disk, you would need to create so-called Docker volumes to
enable persistent data-storage on your local disk. The instructions for setting
this up would be complicated, and it seems much easier to run the Notebooks
using one of the other methods above.
